This repository holds all the code I wrote for my High School courses.

The Word documents file contains .docx files formatted such that each 
project's files are in the same word document.

The workspace is an eclipse workspace that contains most of the submission
code.

The final project folder contains a java applet of the finished project as 
I've lost a lot of the documentation.
